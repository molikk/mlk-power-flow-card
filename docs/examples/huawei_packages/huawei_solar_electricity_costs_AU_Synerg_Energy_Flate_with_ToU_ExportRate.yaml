# Based upon Western Australian energy retailer 'Synergy Energy' and their Flat Rate Tariff Plan.
# v1.0 - Updated 31 March 2024 for Synergy Energy Rates with Flat Rate for Usage, but 3-9pm Peak Export and 'other times' export rate.

#  If you set the prices here, remember to ALSO set them in the 'electricity_import_rate_???' and daily supply charge sensors.
#
#  Grid Import 24x7   : $0.30812 p/kWh.
#  Grid Export (FIT)  : $0.07 p/kWh.
#
# This sensor says if the power_meter_active_power is <=0 (Importing from Grid) then the sensor reports the RATE1 price
# Alternatively if the power_meter_active_power >0 (Exporting to Grid) then the sensor reports the RATE2 price, that is set to ZERO.
# This allows the electricity_price sensor to then be used as a source to calculate things like 'How much did the HVAC cost' that reflects
# the HVAC using power that can change between paid for grid power, and free power from your solar plant.
